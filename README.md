The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) collects, analyzes, and disseminates independent and impartial energy information to promote sound policymaking, efficient markets, and public understanding of energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment.

At EIA, we’re always striving to make our products more transparent and accessible. Releasing our code under an open-source license helps us meet this priority. Over time, we plan to add code repositories associated with select EIA products. Our hope is that releasing code engenders trust, fosters understanding, and allows stakeholders to make better use of our products. 


## License
All EIA projects will be released under Apache 2.0, unless otherwise specifically noted within the project respository. [**Apache 2.0**](https://github.com/EIAgov/EIAgov/blob/main/LICENSE) is a permissive, well-recognized, and popular license, that gives users permission to reuse code for nearly any purpose, including using the code as part of proprietary software. 

## How To Contribute
Federal employees, fellow agencies and members of the public are encouraged to contribute to the success of EIA by sharing feedback and suggestions. Each code repository will have specific guidance on how to engage.

## Governance
EIA wants to ensure a consistent experience for stakeholders who wish to provide feedback. Requests must follow EIA’s contributing guidelines; please see our [**Contribute**](https://github.com/EIAgov/EIAgov/blob/main/CONTRIBUTE.md) guidance or the file within each repo for more details on making contributions.

EIA will review the feedback and formulate a response as appropriate. In cases that warrant a response, EIA will provide written feedback to the contributor. The process and reasons used to reach a decision will be described in each contribution resolution. The goal is to communicate feedback within a reasonable timeframe (e.g. 30 days or less), however, larger contributions may require a more thorough review and therefore require longer review periods.

We strongly encourage individuals working on model enhancements that would like to contribute back to the EIA repository to send an email to the appropriate project team before beginning work.

## Code Of Conduct
If you wish to engage with us, please review our [**Code Of Conduct**](https://github.com/EIAgov/EIAgov/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
