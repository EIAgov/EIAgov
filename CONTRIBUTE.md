Welcome to U.S. Energy Information Administrationâ€™s (EIA) Contributing Guide.  Thank you for investing your time to our projects! Please read our Code of Conduct which we hold very important to creating a positive environment for contributors.  

To get an overview of an individual project, please see the README.MD file for an individual repository.  EIA's profile README.md can be found [here](https://github.com/EIAgov/EIAgov/blob/main/README.md).

The email address for each Project Team can be found in the README.md and/or CONTRIBUTE.md for each repository.

EIA will provide written feedback to a contributor for any issue/bug/feature/change expressed. The process and reasons used to reach a decision will be described in each contribution resolution. The goal is to communicate a final decision within 30 days of submission, but larger contributions may require a design review and therefore require longer review periods.

## Do you have an issue?  Did you find a bug?
Please direct issues or bugs to EIA-RepoName-GITHUB@eia.gov. The <EIA Project Name> Team will communicate all issues or bugs (status/resolution) via an ISSUES file within each repository.

If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem or bug, please open a new one by emailing EIA-RepoName-GITHUB@eia.gov. Be sure to include a title and clear description, with as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Do you intend to propose a new feature or change an existing one?
Suggest your change by sending an email to EIA-RepoName-GITHUB@eia.gov.

## Do you have questions/concerns about the source code?
Ask any question or express any concerns about a project to <EIA Project Name> via EIA-RepoName-GITHUB@eia.gov.
